# Todo-list
## This is a simple todo-list application. I found in a tutorial online
It implements full crud and uses mongodb, express, react, and node js.

It was fun to work on. It was interesting to see how the application sends requests between the front and back ends of an application - using cors. Going forward, I would prefer not to expose every server endpoint and would use whitelisting instead, but, it was still fun to see how it worked.
